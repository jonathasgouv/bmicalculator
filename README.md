# BMI Calculator
**Version 1.0.0**

A simple electron BMI Calculator. 

BMI is a reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. It is used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems. Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening method for weight category—underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obesity.

BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat. Furthermore, BMI appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease outcome as are these more direct measures of body fatness.
